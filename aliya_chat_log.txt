Aliya: Kane! Stop talking!
Aliya: I'm gonna save you!
Aliya: | promisel!!
Aliya: What?
Aliya: Stop talking nonsense!
Aliya: | promise!!!
Aliya: Forget what the manual says!
Aliya: The real you is right here in fro nt of me, and I’m not gonna let you die!
Aliya: | swear!
Aliya: The real you is right here in fr ont of me, and I’m not gonna let you die!
Aliya: Calm down, Aliya
Aliya: Calm down
Aliya: Right now, Kane’s got a brok en rib from the impact
Aliya: and he’s developing tension pneumothorax
Aliya: PUryse wriae wis manual says:
Aliya: We need a thick needle to rel ease the pressure
Aliya: A needle...
Aliya: | got it!
Aliya: This should work...
Aliya: But where do | insert it...
Aliya: | should’ve paid more attenti on in that training class!
Aliya: COSMOS, are you still not reb ooted?
Aliya: COSMOS!?
Player: I'm here
Aliya: Tell me where to insert the n eedle for the tension pneumo thorax!
Aliya: How am | supposed to know! 2?
Player: How can you don't know abo ut it?
Aliya: Go check it out!
Aliya: Check your database!
Aliya: Hurry up!
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:13
Player: Second intercostal space
Aliya: Yes! That’s gotta be it!
Aliya: Kane, hold on!
Aliya: Phew, it’s done
Aliya: ut it?
Aliya: Kane, | told you | wouldn't let you die
Aliya: COSMOS
Aliya: Thanks for the help this time
Player: I'm not COSMOS
Aliya: Why would you respond like this?
Aliya: Maybe it's a glitch in the prog ram
Aliya: But whatever
Aliya: | need a few minutes to get K ane into the hibernation pod
Aliya: We'll talk about this afterwar d
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:15
Aliya: Alright, Kane’s in the hibernat ion pod now
Aliya: He’s safe
Aliya: Let’s continue
Aliya: COSMOS is the Al onboard th is ship
Aliya: I've known COSMOS since | was a kid
Aliya: So, if you're not COSMOS
Aliya: who you really are?
Player: | just launched a game on Ste am, and suddenly your mess ages started popping up in th is window
Aliya: Wait, you're saying you're a human!?
Aliya: What | mean is, you're a real person?
Aliya: Uh, hold on a moment while | figure out how to phrase this
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:16
Aliya: So, you're a real person, and by some coincidence, we ma naged to connect?
Player: Yes
Aliya: Even though | have no idea h ow COSMOS managed to co ntact you...
Aliya: This is such a stroke of luck!
Aliya: Nageu vo connects
Aliya: cough
Aliya: | might be getting a little too excited here
Aliya: Restoring communication me ans our chances of survival h ave just skyrocketed! Yes
Aliya: Restoring communication me ans our chances of survival h ave just skyrocketed!
Aliya: Although, my request might s ound a bit presumptuous
Aliya: Could you come rescue our s hip in the Koranth 2 star syst em, near the Mifrey mining ar ea?
Aliya: Our ship is currently in emerg ency docking orbit around Ko ranth 2-B
Aliya: ans our chances of survival h ave just skyrocketed!
Aliya: Eh... but since this is part of t he Mifrey Company’s mining area
Aliya: You might need to register y our arrival ahead of time
Aliya: hip in the Koranth 2 star syst em, near the Mifrey mining ar ea?
Aliya: Otherwise, there's a chance Mifrey might issue a warrant for your arrest
Aliya: Sorry, we're pretty far out he re
Aliya: You'd need to raise your ship’ s warp level pretty high
Aliya: Fuel costs alone would be ast ronomical
Aliya: Now that | think about it, it's probably not very realistic for you
Aliya: Or, you could just inform Tayr is Company of our situation, and that would work too!
Aliya: Once they know what's goin g on, they'll probably send ar escue team
Aliya: I'm counting on you for every thing
Aliya: Our lives are in your hands!
Player: Hold on! | know you're anxiou s, but just hang on a sec!
Aliya: Sorry, | got a bit too excited
Aliya: Please, you go first
Player: Are you just playing some kin d of space role- playing game with me?
Aliya: I'm in no mood for playing an y kind of role- playing game right now
Aliya: Why are you questioning me like this?
Player: Because interstellar travel tec hnology isn't something we h ave in our time
Aliya: Wait a minute,
Aliya: what year is it over there?
Player: 2025
Aliya: But it’s supposed to be 3025 this year, right?
Player: You... live 1000 years in the f uture?
Aliya: That’s what it looks like
Player: How did so much time pass b etween us?
Aliya: | don’t know either
Aliya: The fact that COSMOS sudde nly turned into a human sign al is weird enough
Aliya: let alone the fact that the sig nal is from nearly 1000 years ago
Aliya: Too bad I'm not COSMOS. If | were, | could definitely help y ou out
Aliya: Even though you're not COS MOS
Aliya: you still helped me save Kane
Aliya: , didn’t you?
Aliya: I'm really grateful for that
Aliya: Alright, enough of that
Aliya: ago
Aliya: Let's focus on what we shoul d do next
Player: You're right, I'll try to think of something to help you too
Aliya: Thanks
Aliya: Let me start by explaining m y situation
Aliya: The ship’s currently stationed over Koranth 2-B
Aliya: Hmm...
Aliya: Let me just show you directly
Aliya: Hold on a sec
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:19
Aliya: Look, here’s the photo | just t ook
Aliya: That huge reddish- brown planet is Koranth 2-B
Aliya: the innermost planet in the K oranth 2 red dwarf star syste m
Aliya: It’s tidally locked, so one side always faces the star
Aliya: What you're seeing now is its sunlit side
Aliya: It’s about 1000 light- years from Earth
Aliya: It's tidally locked, so one side always faces the star
Player: | can see you reflected in the glass
Aliya: That's not the point!
Aliya: I'm mainly using this photo to explain my situation here
Aliya: This research ship is called th e Otter
Aliya: We're part of Tayris’ interstell ar research team
Aliya: My name is Aliya, a biology s pecialist
Aliya: and I'm 24
Aliya: Oh, | forgot to ask your name !
Aliya: What should | call you?
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:20
Player: Ranmeru
Aliya: So I'll call you Ranmeru?
Aliya: Actually, | thought about it... Maybe | should pick a more r ealistic name
Player: Richard
Aliya: So I'll call you Richard?
Aliya: Yeah, just call me Richard
Aliya: Alright, Richard, where were we?
Aliya: Oh, right
Aliya: We were talking about the cr ew
Aliya: Ryoko is the captain and a ge ologist
Aliya: Kane is the engineer
Aliya: the one currently lying in the hibernation pod
Aliya: We're part of Tayris’ team ex ploring humanity’s uncharted frontiers
Aliya: Well, most of the time, we're j ust surveying and sampling v arious planets
Aliya: This time, we were sent to Ko ranth 2
Aliya: but right after our jump, we g ot hit by a small meteorite
Aliya: causing significant damage t 0 the ship
Player: Have you assessed the dama ge to the ship?
Aliya: The control panel is filled with red error messages
Aliya: I'm honestly trying to avoid lo oking at them
Aliya: because they stress me out
Aliya: But don’t worry, | still have a good grasp of the ship's curr ent damage
Player: What should we do first, then ?
Aliya: Right now, both the engine r oom and the oxygen generat or have issues
Aliya: The temperature control in th e incubation chamber seems to have lost power
Aliya: If the engine room isn’t fixed
Aliya: At this rate, the Otter will cras h into Koranth 2- B in a short while
Aliya: And the oxygen generator ha s completely stopped workin g
Aliya: | don’t know how much long er the remaining oxygen will | ast
Aliya: The incubation chamber isn’t as urgent, but there are impo rtant samples inside
Aliya: Even if we solve all that, the warp drive is totally unusable
Aliya: Ugh... this is so frustrating
Player: Your life is the most importan t thing right now, so go chec k on the oxygen generator’s condition
Aliya: Alright
Aliya: I'll head there right away
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:24
Aliya: I'm at the oxygen generator
Aliya: Shoot
Aliya: The CO?-to- water converter is completel y broken
Aliya: But the water electrolysis par t just has a few minor issues
Aliya: Should be able to fix it quick y
Aliya: Ill head there right away
Aliya: Good thing | came here first
Player: Yeah, finish it up quickly, savi ng time to tackle the remaini ng issues
Aliya: I'll be as quick as | can
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:26
Aliya: Uh...
Aliya: y broken
Aliya: There's a problem
Aliya: | just fixed the malfunction
Aliya: Should be able to fix it quickl y
Aliya: But the oxygen generator still isn’t working
Aliya: That’s odd
Aliya: There’s a problem
Aliya: It should be functioning with out any issue
Player: Did you press the start butto n of it?
Aliya: How could | make that kind o f mistake?
Aliya: Wait...
Aliya: | just checked it once
Aliya: Pressed the EOG button agai n
Player: EOG? Seems like it works on my end
Aliya: You can actually control the oxygen generator from your side?
Aliya: Forget it, now’s not the time t o worry about that
Aliya: Just start it up
Aliya: The generator’s running!
Aliya: Awesome!
Aliya: The oxygen generator will au to shut off once filled
Aliya: Please keep an eye on oxyge n levels
Aliya: By the way
Aliya: Since you have control over t he oxygen generator
Aliya: Can you also turn on the radi o?
Aliya: We might pick up something useful
Aliya: We've got a signal!
Aliya: And it’s an unknown one!
Aliya: Could be extraterrestrial life!
Aliya: Try tuning it in a bit
Aliya: But for now, all we can do is | isten to this signal
Aliya: If Otter’s warp drive ever wor ks again, we've gotta go che ck it out!
Aliya: And keep an ear out on the r adio too
Aliya: we ve gota signal:
Aliya: might catch something usefu i}
Aliya: Alright, time to settle the next problem
Player: Go to the engine room
Aliya: But the incubation chamber
Aliya: There's something important in there
Player: Alright, just head to the incub ation chamber first
Aliya: I'll get it done ASAP
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:29
Aliya: I'm in the incubation chambe r
Aliya: Oh god
Aliya: It’s freezing in here
Aliya: Thankfully, the samples are st ill viable
Aliya: Looks like | didn’t lose too mu ch time at the oxygen genera tor
Aliya: Next...
Aliya: | can move the samples to an other compartment
Aliya: The temperature there isn’t i deal
Aliya: But it’s much better than in t he current incubation chamb er
Aliya: Alright, hurry up. We still got the engine room issue
Aliya: One good thing about space is heavy things are easy tom ove
Aliya: But because of that, | still hav e to unlock the fixtures
Aliya: Seems like it’s not very easy t o unlock
Aliya: I'll need some time
Aliya: But I'll get it done ASAP
Aliya: Ahhh!!
Player: What happened!? Are you okay?
Aliya: I'm fine
Aliya: It just moved a bit and scared me
Aliya: Still need some time to unloc kit
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:35
Aliya: Alright
Aliya: All the viable samples are out
Aliya: Now I can...
Aliya: What was that sound?
Aliya: Whatever it is, it’s definitely n ot a good sign for the Otter
Player: Maybe it was just a pressure cooker blowing up
Aliya: It's not funny...
Aliya: I'm going over to check it out
Aliya: Hope it’s nothing too catastr ophic
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:38
Aliya: It’s the pressure cooker
Aliya: but, uh, the one in the engine room
Aliya: ot a good sign for the Otter
Aliya: the pressure valve blew unde r high pressure
Aliya: cooker blowing up
Aliya: Luckily, it was just the pressu re valve
Aliya: | can fix this up in a bit
Aliya: If the whole engine core had blown, you wouldn't be heari ng from me right now
Aliya: Good news is we don’t have to worry about the engine ro om anymore
Aliya: but the Otter might not be ab le to travel around freely afte r this
Aliya: I'll ignore this alarm for now
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:43
Aliya: Finally
Aliya: the crisis is temporarily resolv ed
Aliya: Phew...
Aliya: I'm exhausted
Aliya: Thank you, Richard
Aliya: without you
Aliya: | honestly wouldn't know wh at to do
Aliya: Wait
Aliya: This error message...
Aliya: The main fuel port isn’t activa
Aliya: The main fuel port isn’t activa ted?
Aliya: The access to the main fuel p ort... don’t tell me you have i t?
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:44
Player: What’s the name of it?
Aliya: EH
Player: But it’s not operational
Aliya: Don't worry
Aliya: Once the ship's engine starts, it will grant access
Aliya: I'll need your help then
Aliya: Hope it won't be too tricky to operate
Aliya: It won't be
Aliya: Just follow my lead when the time comes
Aliya: Phew, looks like things are un der control now
Aliya: What a relief
Aliya: The Otter’s in a state where we can at least keep going
Aliya: like a revived Otter!
Aliya: All thanks to yours truly, the genius engineer!
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:45
Player: Didn’t you just say you were a biologist?
Aliya: Heh
Aliya: don’t underestimate me
Aliya: I've got an eighth- level spaceship maintenance cert
Aliya: According to the manual
Aliya: an eighth- level tech can even do solo E VA repairs
Aliya: though | really hope Otter do esn’t end up needing anythin g fixed that requires a space walk
Player: Impressive, no wonder you m anaged to fix Otter up so well this time
Aliya: As much as | want to say yes
Aliya: honestly, I’m still kind of freak ed out
Aliya: One lucky thing this time is th at Otter’s major issues were a Il things | could fix
Aliya: like, stuff | just happen to kno w
Aliya: if it were any harder, I'd prob ably just have to watch Otter fall into Koranth 2-B
Aliya: It’s like the teacher set the te st questions based on my rev ision notes
Aliya: Next time, | might not be so | ucky
Aliya: If | survive this time, | definitel y need to hit the training cou tses harder
Aliya: And there’s one more thing...
Aliya: As much as | hate to admit it
Aliya: my dad always taught me to be straightforward
Aliya: so, thank you
Aliya: for sticking with me through all this
Aliya: and if you're up for it...
Aliya: | could really use your help fr om here on out
Aliya: Of course, what's the next pl an?
Aliya: | don’t know
Player: What do you mean?
Aliya: How would | know?
Aliya: Right now, the best option mi ght just be to do nothing
Aliya: waiting for the company to s end a ship over
Player: Why don’t you just get in the hibernation pod?
Aliya: Nope
Aliya: the Tayris manual says
Aliya: “A spaceship must always ha ve at least one person in ana ctive state”
Aliya: Mow would | Knows
Aliya: even during hibernation
Aliya: to prevent accidents from goi ng unaddressed
Aliya: Right now, Kane's in the pod
Aliya: so | have to stay on standby
Aliya: And the hibernation pod isn’t what you think
Aliya: It’s more like deep sleep
Aliya: Right now, Kane’s in the pod
Aliya: and only lasts 3- 6 months at most
Aliya: Plus, it takes a long rehab tim e when you wake up
Aliya: Will Tayris really come rescue you?
Aliya: The manual also says
Aliya: “No matter where the danger is
Aliya: the company will try its best t o send help”
Aliya: But | could be found by Mifre y first
Aliya: either way, | should survive
Aliya: 2025/05/04 04:48
Player: Why did you come all the wa y out here?
Aliya: Of course, it’s for exploration and research
Aliya: | mean
Aliya: people from your time seeme d pretty interested in the unk nown deep space, right?
Aliya: Just looking at the stars from a mountaintop would evoke so much wonder
Aliya: But in my time, most people don’t care much about the st ars
Aliya: Still, for us researchers
Aliya: any unknown planet has tre mendous exploration value
Aliya: It's quite appealing
Aliya: Every time we head into unc harted deep space, there’s th is excitement and thrill
Aliya: It's enough to almost make y ou forget the dangers of dee Pp space
Player: So are you basically adventur ers? You're scientists, but yo u're doing some pretty dang erous work
Aliya: You could say that
Aliya: Kind of like the sailors explori ng Earth during the Age of Ex ploration
Aliya: The term “astronaut” originall y means “space sailor”
Aliya: The mortality rate is indeed h igh
Aliya: and that's how people like us came to be...
Aliya: Never mind...
Player: What? Your hesitation makes me concerned
Aliya: Because...
Aliya: Ouch!
Aliya: That hurt!
Player: What’s going on? Are you ok ay?
Aliya: I'm fine
Aliya: Just got hit on the head by a book floating around on my way to the living quarters
Player: Glad you're not hurt
Aliya: You're pretty caring, huh?
Aliya: Let me see...
Aliya: What kind of book cover is th is hard
Aliya: Why We Live, Why We Die
Aliya: Wow...
Aliya: This has to be one of Kane’s books
Aliya: way to the living quarters
Player: That title’s pretty deep, huh?
Aliya: Exactly
Aliya: Kane loves these strange- titled books
Aliya: And only his books would be floating around
Aliya: Ryoko and | keep our things pretty organized
Aliya: Kane is meticulous with elect ronics
Aliya: But his own belongings are a different story
Aliya: It’s not like he’s trying to be a rtsy
Aliya: but he has a lot of books that he’s barely read
Aliya: Haha!
Aliya: This one’s the same
Aliya: Look at where the bookmark is
Aliya: Tsk...
Aliya: Wait a sec
Aliya: What's inside here?
Player: What is it? Let me have a loo k
Aliya: he’s barely read
Aliya: Oh
Aliya: This is a group photo we too k back then
Aliya: It even says “Precious Memor ies” on the back
Aliya: | think | saved a copy on my t ablet
Aliya: | can send it to you
Aliya: Ican send it to you
Aliya: How about it?
Aliya: kback then
Aliya: Looks nice, right?
Aliya: Guess which one is me
Player: The one on the right
Aliya: You guessed right
Aliya: Seems like my way of talking matches my appearance, hu h?
Player: Yeah, you've got that cute, e nergetic vibe
Aliya: Right, right?
Aliya: You think so too, don’t you?
Player: What’s up with Kane’s expres sion?
Aliya: Kane?
Aliya: He says he doesn’t like taking selfies
Aliya: Even though he came out wit h us, he told us to take it ours elves
Aliya: He says he doesn't like taking selfies
Aliya: In the end, Ryoko made him j oin in
Aliya: Didn't think he treasured this photo so much
Aliya: And yet, here | am finding ou t
Aliya: What a contradictory guy
Player: Ryoko should've been into it, so why does her expression | ook... strange too?
Aliya: Haha
Aliya: Maybe it’s because | lifted he t off the ground
Aliya: Her feet weren't touching the floor
Aliya: She's really sensitive about h er height
Aliya: | thought it was cute
Aliya: If we meet again, I'd like to tr y lifting her up one more tim e
Aliya: and hear her scold me in that captain’s tone, haha
Aliya: This was a close- up we took when we snuck o ut of the company “courtyar d” together
Aliya: You'd never guess Kane was the one who planned it
Player: No way? He looks like such a quiet, obedient guy
Aliya: Obedient?
Aliya: Wee He yey eee y lifting her up one more tim e
Aliya: He’s far from that
Aliya: He’s practically on the monthl y reprimand list every month
Aliya: up we took when we snuck o ut of the company “courtyar d” together
Aliya: Once, he even talked back to a supervisor in the cafeteria, giving him no way out
Aliya: But because he’s so good at what he does, he never face d real punishment
Aliya: Honestly, my first impression of him was similar to yours
Aliya: But because he’s so good at what he does, he never face dreal punishment
Aliya: Then | realized he’s a bit of a punk
Aliya: But he treats us well
Aliya: definitely a lion to outsiders, a lamb to insiders
Aliya: a supervisor in the cafeteria, giving him no way out
Aliya: Maybe Ryoko keeps him in c heck?
Aliya: That’s probably it
Aliya: But there were other reasons too...
Aliya: Anyway, Ryoko is super serio us
Aliya: That's probably it
Aliya: All she talks about are rules a nd regulations
Aliya: She scolds me a lot
Aliya: So I secretly call her “old- fashioned loli” behind her bac k
Aliya: But she still snuck out to play with us
Aliya: Guess the “kid” in her still lov es to have fun
Aliya: Ah
Aliya: | really want to sneak out wit h them again...
Player: Aliya...
Aliya: Let’s not talk about this for n Ow
Aliya: | need to take a shower
Aliya: I've sweated a lot today
Aliya: If | don’t wash up soon, I'll sta rt to stink
Aliya: Shower? The ship still got wa ter for showers?
Aliya: The water is recycled and filt ered
Aliya: A shower barely uses any wa ter at all
Player: So, you're basically drinking y our own shower water later?
Aliya: If you put it that way
Aliya: Well
Aliya: | guess you're not wrong
Aliya: But that’s a gross way to put it!
Player: Alright, alright, I'll zip it, go tak e your shower
Aliya: our own shower water later?
Aliya: just to confirm
Aliya: You don’t have camera acces s, right?
Player: Why do you ask?
Aliya: No, no, no problem at all
Aliya: I'm off to shower now
Aliya: Catch you later
Aliya: La la lalala~
Aliya: I'm a little red panda, oh!
Aliya: Rolling forward, here | go!
Aliya: Round and cuddly, cute and small~
Aliya: Lala la lala~
Aliya: 2025/05/04 05:07
Aliya: Aliya, did you hear somethin g?
Aliya: When | was showering, | thou ght | heard something from t he air ducts
Aliya: Air ducts? I'm talking about t he radio!
Aliya: What!?
Aliya: Adjust the frequency to mak e the sound clearer! Now!
Aliya: I'm on my way!
Aliya: Hope it’s another survey tea m passing by
Aliya: 2025/05/04 05:08
Aliya: It’s a signal from Mifrey Com pany’s Lagrange Point outpo st
Aliya: Stop rushing me
Aliya: I'm already trying to sync the speed
Aliya: Why are you more excited th an me?
Aliya: Of course I'm excited! I'd be h appy if you could be rescued!
Aliya: You're really this worried abo ut me?
Aliya: If | don’t make it home, would n't you be heartbroken?
Aliya: Don't joke like that!
Aliya: Alright, no more jokes
Aliya: Whether or not | make it bac k
Aliya: we have to believe everythin g will work out
Aliya: Anyway
Aliya: I'm definitely going back
Aliya: And when | do, I'll get to sho w you the flowers | grew mys elf
Aliya: Being a biologist, | actually ha ve my own little garden
Player: Sure! That's a promise!
Aliya: You'll see them
Aliya: | promise
Aliya: Alright
Aliya: now we've got a little proble m
Aliya: Remember that issue | menti oned earlier?
Aliya: You'll need to handle the mai n fuel valve of the ship
Aliya: I've already adjusted our cour se
Aliya: so when | say “go,” you'll ope n the EH valve for about 8 se conds, then shut it off
Aliya: You'll have to time it yourself
Aliya: Too long or too short and we’ Il miss the target completely
Aliya: Worst- case scenario, we overshoot and crash right into the outp ost
Aliya: Got it?
Player: Got it, leave it to me
Aliya: That's the spirit!
Aliya: here we go!
Aliya: Get ready
Aliya: Gol!!!
Aliya: Nice!
Aliya: Perfect!
Aliya: Now, let’s get connected to t hat satellite
Aliya: Time to go EVA
Aliya: | just took a shower, and now | have to suit up again...
Aliya: But | guess it’s worth it
Player: Be careful
Aliya: Don't worry!
Aliya: | aced my EVA exam, top of t he class
Aliya: Many of my classmates were jealous of my grades
Aliya: Alright,
Aliya: I'll let you know if anything co mes up
Aliya: 2025/05/04 05:15
Aliya: Bad news—
Aliya: The Mifrey outpost is down
Aliya: Looks like we won't be able t 0 contact with them
Player: It's down!? How did that hap pen?
Aliya: Looks like it’s just been runni ng for way too longAliya: It's something from way back
Aliya: and the timing system’s com pletely messed up
Aliya: But the data logs should still be intact
Aliya: I'll need some time to retrieve the data tablet
Aliya: 2025/05/04 05:26
Aliya: Whew, I’m back
Aliya: Another perfect EVA,
Aliya: and | brought back the confid ential data tablet from the en emy company
Aliya: It might be illegal,
Aliya: but out here in the middle of nowhere, who's going to be t he witness?
Player: What's the data tablet for?
Aliya: Outposts like this will record t he data they observe,
Aliya: such as the operation of this galaxy and the status of the s tar
Aliya: That’s why it’s placed at the Lagrange point of Koranth 2- B
Aliya: But for me, the more importa nt thing is that
Aliya: it also records any spacecraft passing by
Aliya: | found it
Aliya: he data they observe,
Aliya: This must be the record of w hen my father came here
Aliya: Let me see
Aliya: The flight path...
Aliya: and the data after that...
Aliya: No way...
Aliya: There's nothing else...
Player: Aliya... what's the deal with y our father?
Aliya: My father was an interstellar explorer
Aliya: He mostly worked on contrac ts for companies
Aliya: But after my mom passed aw ay from a genetic illness whe nl was 8,
Aliya: he never went on another fli ght
Aliya: Then, one month before my 14th birthday,
Aliya: he told me he had one last m ission
Aliya: He said he’d bring me back a birthday gift
Aliya: But...
Aliya: he never came back
